## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: Instagram
- Highlights - Give the chance to organize the stories and keep those on your profile
- Archives - Having the ability to archive the not wanted photos and to show those again after a certain time without reposting the content again.
  
App: Facebook
- Groups: We can create and join communities with the same interests
- Reels: Combining different videos and pictures to create one content
  
App: BeReal
- Sharing live content at an unspecified time each day
- Reaction - Reacting with different kinds of emojis at friends' live content

The app idea: AR filters are currently in extremely high demand. These filters, crafted by developers, are sought after by influencers and bloggers from various fields. My iOS app aims to bridge the gap, providing a platform that connects bloggers with a diverse range of developers specializing in creating AR filters. This endeavor has the potential to foster a unique and collaborative environment within the AR world.
 

## Notes

The submission part was the part that I am struggling with more. With the right research and help from Codepath, I would be able to succeed with this part.
